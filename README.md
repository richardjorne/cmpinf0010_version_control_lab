# Zodiac Sign Finder

A simple Python program in Jupyter Notebook that tells you your zodiac sign based on your birthdate.

## What It Does
1. Asks for your name.
2. Asks for your birthdate (MM/DD format).
3. Tells you your zodiac sign.

## How It Works
1. Checks Your Input
- Makes sure the date is in MM/DD format and is a real date.
- If the date is wrong (like 13/32), it shows an error.
2. Finds Your Zodiac Sign
- Looks at the month and day to figure out your sign.
- Example: If your birthday is between March 21 and April 19, youâ€™re an Aries.
3. Shows the Result
- Prints a message with your name and zodiac sign.
